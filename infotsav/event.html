                Marketing is as important as manufacturing. Marketing is the mother to the product who showcases it to the world. A product that is not properly marketed is equal to not properly manufactured. If you know marketing then you are no less than a manufacturer. Your mastery in marketing helps a mass of manufacturers to make mass money. Bring out the brands that are buried in you.

               The universe is built out of ideas. An Idea that is generated due to mere play of electrons in the neurons can be the most powerful weapon only when it is implemented. Implementation is the language that ideas can be spoken in, INFOTSAV provides a stage where the ideas are not merely spoken but are shouted. Ideas get their expiry date from your heads if they are not properly utilised by getting them out of your heads onto a paper.
